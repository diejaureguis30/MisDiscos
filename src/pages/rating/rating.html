            I've been an Eminem fan from day one but hadn't purchased any of his albums, so this was a no brainer for me - it includes all of his best singles from his debut up until 2005 when this was released. My personal favorites are "The Way I Am," his song about telling the media to f*** off (I'm sure most celebrities find this to be their anthem), "Guilty Conscience" featuring Dr. Dre, "Just Lose It," "Without Me," and "Mockingbird" (a heartfelt song for his daughter). For me, every song on this album is fantastic and familiar and there's no filler. Obviously, since it's a greatest hits CD, you already know what you're getting as far as the older material, but the real gem on here is the new song "When I'm Gone." It's a more serious song about how his life as a rapper interferes with his family life since he's gone all the time and he uses great imagery to portray how it negatively affects his daughter. As a fan, it makes you appreciate the sacrifices made to put music out for us and think about it in a way you haven't before.

            This is an awesome CD with all his greatest singles and few new tunes too! Highly recommended!

              Its just a look into the career that Eminem has had and obviously there are going to be people that dont like what he's saying that's cool. I happened to enjoy the cd on the whole. Curtain Call has a good mix of hits that Em has had over the years like "The Way I Am", "Stan feat Dido" (one of my favs by him), "Lose Yourself", "Cleanin Out My Closet", "Sing for the Moment and the new cut "When I'm Gone". Its one of the most personal records by him that i've heard in awhile and its pretty deep. I love those from him.

              But i also enjoy the songs where he's clowning or just having fun like "My Name Is", "Shake That" w/Nate Dogg (with a sick beat to it) and "Just Lose It". I just enjoy that Eminem is never afraid to say whats up and even though sometimes he goes overboard.."Fack". He still does like he wants to do it and thats no bullcrap or drama. He just delivers the message straight whomever.
              
              Curtain Call is a good purchase for those looking to get some of his songs. But don't want to go buying all his cds.

                What can you say? Eminem is a legend, and this is a great collection of his music. Strangely enough, the track listing is off by at least one song one all 4 sides of the 2 albums. But that's just my OCD, not Eminem's fault
