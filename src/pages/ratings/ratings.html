          Hot Fuss is a hell of a record. The first 5 tracks off this sensational debut effort could easily be five tracks of a greatest hits album. This CD pretty much epitomizes the new wave rock of 2004. A perfect blend of synth pop, indie rock, glam, and dance all rolled up into one. This is most definitely one of the best albums of the 2000's. There isn't a bad track, in my opinion, and it's one of those rare gems where you can play the entire album from front to back without just having a couple decent tracks to repeat. My favorite tracks are Jennie Was a Friend of Mine and All These Things I've Done, but I thoroughly enjoy all the others as well. Not just an incredible debut album, but a solid, top notch one in general. 5/5 stars

            This is a very good album that most will enjoy, I have always been a fan of the killers this is the best album in my opinion. The following is based on sound quality and not the music itself. I am a light audiophile and I have to say this cd should only be played in car or speakers. In general this album is VERY loud. But I'm referring to how the loudness drowns everything out. No instrument separation and poor soundstage. The sound quality is muddy and compressed I listen to the FLAC file on my Dt 990s and could hardly bare to listen. Do not buy for headphones if you own a decent pair. They need a complete overhaul remaster. But like I said this does not ruin the album as a whole.

              Was anyone else looking for this record a couple years back and it was like freaking 340 dollars or something crazy like that? Saw someone bought this and flipped a table because I KNEW they were just as broke as me and tadaaa for some reason now this is affordable and you better buy it because it is the best album of our time
