        I'm 67 years old , I've made a living playing and teaching music for the better part of my life , I come from a different musical time period , I don't remember the last time I purchased a CD by a newer popular mainstream artist . The material on Lady Gaga's CD "Joanne" is stunning ! She is a young lady with an old soul , absolutely wonderful. I think she is very possibly the greatest talent of this era.
        I really like Born This Way and (most of) ArtPop. I liked their ambition, though the deluxe edition of BTW actually diluted that album's power, and ArtPop strayed a bit at times. With Joanne, though, Lady Gaga has embraced everything that she's best at: Great singing, great songs, wonderful rhythms, tones, and production. Take away the visuals that are so key to her persona, and just listen to her music, and you get an expressive voice. Paired with high quality songs, she stands out not just for her extracurricular activities and outlandish glam outfits, but for being one the premier artists working on the worldwide stage today.

          Certainly this comes with a lot of hype. The singles leading up to the release indicated we were in for a good one, but the full album, taken as a whole, is even better. From the very beginning of Diamond Heart, through a variety of styles (dance pop, rock, R&B, and even country), until the end, this album never gets boring and never disappoints. I don't know if this will dominate the charts, and I couldn't care less: as a fan, I'm incredibly happy to hear Gaga doing what she does best. I suspect this album will stand the test of time and will be notable as a high-water mark in an already impressive career.
          I love Lady Gaga. She's interesting, fascinating and amazing. I love it that she's always changing, evolving, trying something new. JOANNE is a different sound for this talented singer, but I love it and I'm not very easy to please. "PERFECT ILLUSION" is one of my favorite songs on this CD. From that first guitar lick, I'm hooked and I can't stop playing the song over and over again yet I love a lot of the songs. I like it that the CD has various music styles and her voice fits them all. "DANCIN' IN CIRCLES" has a reggae feel to it and I love it. I just want to get up and dance the night away to it. "JOHN WAYNE" might seem like an odd title for a song, but I love it and every time I play it, I want to go out and find myself a cowboy. "A-YO" (makes me want to get up and jump around; even grab a guitar and play a few licks), "HEY GIRL" (Lady Gaga and Florence Welch sound so darn good singing together; love this song), "MILLION REASONS" (what a catchy chorus; has a country feel to it), "JOANNE" (makes me think of loved ones I've lost) and "SINNER'S PRAYER" (country sound to it; I like the guitar and background effects) are also good songs. "ANGEL DOWN" and "JOANNE" touch the heart strings since they're about people who died too soon. I don't listen to music critics because what they like, I don't like and what they don't like, I do like. The whole CD honestly makes me feel as though I'm right there in the studio as she's recording the songs. The sound is so clean and perfect and pure. Just listen to the song previews and you'll get a small idea of how good this CD is. I usually only like one or two songs on a CD, but with Lady Gaga, every CD has at least four or more songs that I like and listen to over and over again. I'll admit that ARTPOP has ELEVEN songs that I love and still listen to all the time yet now that I have this JOANNE Deluxe CD, I've put ARTPOP aside and just play this one over and over again.

            But while “Joanne” is elemental, nothing about it is bare. Instead, it’s confused, full of songs that feel like concepts in search of a home, small theater pieces extruded from other imaginary productions and collected in one miscellany bin. It’s naïve in its use of roots music and rock as signifiers of something true — as if the excess of years past wasn’t, somehow, its own form of sincerity.
